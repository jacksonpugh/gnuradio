# Amateur GNU Radio Project

Overview: This git repo is an experiment. It starts with a basic overview using tutorials to design simple radio building blocks. Later on, it may delve into Python coding to create more powerful applications. Overall, the goal is to improve knowledge of SDR and RF through data processing experiments.

Let's see how far this gets!
